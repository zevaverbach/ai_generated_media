	<h1>The Giant Gummy Snake</h1>

	<p>At a public pool, surrounded by children splashing and adults lounging in the sun, an oversized, shiny black gummy snake emerged from one of the pool vents. The creature seemed to glisten under the bright sun, and its movements were eerily fluid as it slithered around the pool's edges. At first, parents and lifeguards tried to dismiss it as a pool toy some child had forgotten. But when the snake began to move around the pool deck, people began to scream and run for cover.</p>
	<p>Some tried to flee on foot, but the creature was too quick for them. It seemed to chase after them, relentlessly pursuing the screaming children and adults around the pool. People were tripping over each other in their haste to escape, and the snake – now larger and angrier-looking than ever – seemed to be getting larger with every passing moment.</p>
	<p>Those who were able to watch from a safe distance marvelled at the creature's size and power. It towered over the other pool features, and its glistening scales seemed to reflect the sunlight in a way that made it almost blindingly bright. But as the snake roared and hissed in fury, they began to realize that there was something terrifyingly unnatural about the creature.</p>
	<p>The snake's jaws opened wide, revealing a set of razor-sharp teeth that glinted in the sun. A massive, thick tongue unravelled and retreated far back down the snake's gullet. With a series of quick, final movements, the creature launched itself at the nearest swimmers, biting and swallowing them whole.</p>
	<p>The cleanup was gruesome, a horror beyond words. People who had once laughed and played in the sun now lay torn and ravaged by the snake's monstrous leviathan form. No one knows where the beast came from, nor why it chose the pool as its lair. All we know is that – somewhere, out there – the giant gummy snake still lurks, waiting for its next chance to strike.</p>
