	<h1>The Donkey</h1>
    <img src="the_donkey.jpg" alt="A donkey with no eyes laying back on top of another donkey, smiling between sips of lemonade." style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 25%;"></img>
	<p>The donkey stood there in the field, parched and desperate for a drink. It had been days since the last rain and the sun beat down mercilessly upon its thick coat. The farmer had forgotten to refill the water trough, leaving the poor animal without any relief.</p>

	<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures, thought the donkey. It wandered around the field in search of any source of moisture, eventually coming across a puddle of pee left behind by one of the other farm animals.</p>

	<p>Without hesitation, the donkey lowered its head and began to drink. It tasted foul and the smell made its eyes water, but it was better than nothing. The donkey drank until the puddle was dry and then wandered off in search of more.</p>

	<p>In the distance, the farmer watched through his binoculars as the donkey drank the foul water. He scratched his head and thought to himself, "Well, I'll be damned. That donkey really will drink anything."
    </p>

    <p>And with that, he made a mental note to refill the water trough and provide his animals with fresh, clean water from that day forward. But for the donkey, it was too late. The damage had already been done and it would spend the rest of its days feeling the effects of its desperation.
